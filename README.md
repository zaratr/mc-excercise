What went wrong to cause merge conflicts in this practice scenario? What could cause such conflicts in a real world situation?

Merge conflicts such as those seen between Bob, Carol, Ted, and Alince are a result of a failure to follow the A-C-P pattern, as well as a failure to communicate. If any one contributor ensures that they are always working on the correct up-to-date branch, adding, committing, and pushing appropriately - there are often few conflicts. Secondly, especially with few contributors on a project, always make it known that you are pushing a committ and be aware of any other pushes and merges that have occurered since you began working on a branch.

Essentially, communicate and properly ACP often and you're golden!
